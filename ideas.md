o   Capital freak: responsible for the fundamentals of building a business, like monetization
o   Cake man: telling you how your idea could be 10x better, researching existing strategies/tropes in successful apps, and ultimately just improving your idea for the better
o   Buzz: your marketing guru. Will tell you ideal social media platforms to distribute, your content strategy, and general tips for marketing your idea.
o   Mr. T: purely focused on technical execution. If you’re a dev, this is the agent that will tell you how to actually execute your idea.
