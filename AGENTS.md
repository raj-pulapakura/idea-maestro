You are free to make major changes to the codebase if it is required. Nothing is set in stone - not the API contracts, not the folder structure, not the way the code is written. Update as you see fit.

Keep the repo structured and organised. Component files. Routes. Helper files. Everything should be easily locatable, manageable, and readable. A file, function or class should not have more than one responsibility.
